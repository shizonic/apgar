# Apgar

We wanted a quick, simple and standardized way of doing health checks for the various services in our environment. Apgar walks a directory tree (by default `/etc/apgar/healthchecks`), runs the healthCheck scripts it finds there (in parallel, to keep the run time as short as possible) and aggregates the results into a directory (`/var/lib/apgar` by default). That directory is then served by a simple standalone web server so the results can be used as health checks by Amazon Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups.

## Details

Apgar consists of two parts, `apgar-server` which serves the health information, and `apgar-probe` which collects & aggregates the individual server health checks.

# Writing Checks

An apgar check should be:

* Executable, with a shebang line.
* It should either write "OK" to console and return 0, or write "NOT OK" to console and return anything other than 0.
* It must be named with a '.healthCheck' suffix
* The check should never print anything else unless --verbose is passed on the command line. If called with --quiet, it may print nothing at all, but still return zero or non-zero.
* Check scripts _must not assume that they will be run in a particular order_, or that other check scripts will *not* be running simultaneously with them. To minimize check time, Apgar runs the check scripts in parallel as soon as it finds them.
* Checks should be fast - since apgar will run all the checks in parallel, it is better to have 3 separate tests that each run in N seconds than one test that runs in 3N seconds.
* Checks should be idempotent
* Checks must be non-destructive and not change the state of the underlying service - by definition, they will be run while the service they're checking is in production.

# FAQ

## Why Apgar?

Why not Apgar? Virginia Apgar invented the Apgar score as a method to quickly summarize the health of newborn children. Seemed appropriate for a quick health check system.

## Why not just piggyback on a system's existing web server?

You are of course free to use your own webserver instead of `apgar-server`, but we opted for a stand-alone server for the following reasons:

* I don't want to have to maintain configuration files for every webserver out there
* Not every system has a webserver installed
* Using a standalone server helps minimize Apgar's impact on existing services. Both apgar-server and apgar-probe are written in golang so that using Apgar doesn't pull in any dependencies that might conflict with those needed by the services you actually care about on a system.
* Using a standalone server keeps you from having to alter your existing webserver's configuration to use Apgar.

## Why Go?

I wanted Apgar to have as little impact on the host system as possible. Go gives us static binaries, and it was a good excuse to start learning Go.

## How can I package this so I don't have to build it on every server?

If you have bundler installed, `rake deb` will build a deb, and `rake rpm` will build a rpm.
